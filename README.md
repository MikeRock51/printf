Creating a custom printf function with my partner. This function, like the one that cones with C syandard library, prints a format string, and takes variable number of arguments.  With some extra functionalities. We've added a %r specifier for printing reversed string, and a %R for printing a string with ROT13 encyption.

The function returns the length of string printed.

For this project, we explored our newly acquired knowledge in pointers, struct, typedef, function pointers, nested loops and so much more.

You can use this function by simply calling _printf("") And passing in the appropriate string or format you would like to print.
